# Scraping basketball_reference - Moneyball, but for Basketball

We scrap data about basketball players and teams, since basketball became a thing.

In the long run, this project could make it possible to apply data science to predict the value of a player based on his performances and assess how likely he is to become one of the most valuable players.
