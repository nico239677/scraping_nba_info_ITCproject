# Scraping project: basketball_reference.com
## Moneyball movie, but for Basketball

<p>We scrap data about basketball <strong>players</strong> and <strong>teams</strong>, since basketball became a thing.
<p>In the long run, this project could make it possible to apply data science to predict the value of a player based on his performances and assess how likely he is to become one of the most valuable players.</p>
